### state_audio_sense ###
This state listens for an audio signal on TOSLINK, COAX or (MK2) RCA analog channels and raises TRIGGER_AUDIO_SENSED when signal found
Alternatively, this state also listens for ircode record button press and raises TRIGGER_IRCODE_RECORD when detected

### state_ircode_record ###
This state listens for remote IR controller signal and once it's been captured, it records it to EEPROM and signals TRIGGER_IRCODE_RECORDED

### state_audio_start ###
This state issues the following on enter: 
* IRcode previosly recorded over 3.5mm jack

Next, this state enters listening for audio equipment to enable 12V HIGH state over 3.5mm INPUT jack and signals TRIGGER_AUDIO_ENABLED when detected

### state_audio_enabled ###
This state listens for the 12V LOW state over the 3.5mm INPUT jack and signals TRIGGER_AUDIO_DISABLED when detected
